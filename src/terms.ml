(** Term representation.

    This module defines the main abstract syntax tree representation for terms
    (including types), which relies on the {!module:Bindlib} library. A set of
    functions are also provided for basic term manipulations. *)

(** {6 Term and rewriting rules representation} *)

(** Representation of a term (or type). *)
type term =
  | Vari of term Bindlib.var
  (** Free variable. *)
  | Type
  (** "Type" constant. *)
  | Kind
  (** "Kind" constant. *)
  | Symb of sym
  (** Symbol (static or definable). *)
  | Prod of term * (term, term) Bindlib.binder
  (** Dependent product. *)
  | Abst of term * (term, term) Bindlib.binder
  (** Abstraction. *)
  | Appl of term * term
  (** Application. *)
  | Meta of meta * term array
  (** Metavariable with its environment. *)
  | Patt of int option * string * term array
  (** Pattern variable (used in the LHS of rewriting rules). *)
  | TEnv of term_env * term array
  (** Term environment (used in the RHS of rewriting rules). *)

(** Representation of an higher-order term. *)
 and term_env =
  | TE_Vari of term_env Bindlib.var
  (** Free higher-oder term variable (for printing only). *)
  | TE_Some of (term, term) Bindlib.mbinder
  (** Higher-order term to instantiate the RHS of rewriting rules. *)
  | TE_None
  (** Dummy higher-order term (initial value in RHS environment). *)

(** The {!const:Patt(i,s,ar)} constructor represents a pattern variable, which
    may only appear in the LHS (left hand side or pattern) of rewriting rules.
    It is identified by a {!type:string} name [s] (unique in a rewriting rule)
    and it carries an environment [ar] that should contain a set of (distinct)
    free variables (i.e., terms of the form {!const:Vari(x)}). They correspond
    to the only free variables that may appear in a matched term. Note that we
    must use the type {!type:term array} so that the variable may be bound. In
    particular, the type {!type:tvar array} would not be suitable. The element
    [i] (of type {!type:int option}) gives the index (if any) of the slot that
    is reserved for the matched term in the environment of the RHS (right hand
    side or action) of the rewriting rule. When [i] is {!const:None}, then the
    variable is not bound in the RHS. When it is {!const:Some(i)}, then either
    it is bound in the RHS, or it appears non-linearly in the LHS.

    The {!const:TEnv(te,ar)} constructor corresponds to a form of metavariable
    [te], with an associated environment [ar]. When it is used in the RHS of a
    rewriting rule, the metavariable [te] must be bound. When a rewriting rule
    applies, the metavariables that are bound in the RHS are substituted using
    an environment that was constructed during the matching of the LHS. *)

(** Representation of a constant or function symbol. *)
 and sym =
  { sym_name  : string
  (** Name of the symbol. *)
  ; sym_type  : term ref
  (** Type of the symbol. *)
  ; sym_path  : Files.module_path
  (** Module in which it is defined.  *)
  ; sym_def   : term option ref
  (** Definition of the symbol. *)
  ; sym_rules : rule list ref
  (** Rewriting rules for the symbol. *)
  ; sym_const : bool
  (** Tells whether it is constant.   *) }

(** The {!recfield:sym_type} field contains a reference for a technical reason
    related to the representation of signatures as binary files (see functions
    {!val:Sign.link} and {!val:Sign.unlink}). This is necessary to ensure that
    two identical symbols are always physically equal, even across signatures.
    It should not be mutated for any other reason.

    The rewriting rules associated to a symbol are stored in the symbol itself
    (in the {!recfield:sym_rules}). Note that a symbol should not be given any
    reduction rule if it is marked as constant (i.e., if {!recfield:sym_const}
    has value [true]), or if it has a definition. *)

(** Representation of a rewriting rule. *)
 and rule =
  { lhs   : term list
  (** Left  hand side.  *)
  ; rhs   : (term_env, term) Bindlib.mbinder
  (** Right hand side.  *)
  ; arity : int
  (** Required number of arguments to be applicable. *) }

(** A rewriting rule is formed of a LHS (left hand side), which is the pattern
    that should be matched for the rule to apply, and a RHS (right hand side),
    which gives the action to perform if the rule applies.

    The LHS (or pattern) of a rewriting rule is always formed of a head symbol
    (on which the rule is defined) applied to a list of arguments. The list of
    arguments is given in {!recfield:lhs}, but the head symbol itself does not
    need to be stored in the rule (rules are contained in symbols). In a rule,
    the {!recfield:arity} field gives the number of arguments contained in the
    LHS. In other words, [r.arity] is always equal to [List.length r.lhs], and
    it gives the minimal number of arguments that is required to match the LHS
    of the rule.

    The RHS (or action) or a rewriting rule is represented by a term, in which
    metavariables of type {!type:term_env} are bound. These metavariables must
    be substituted with an environment of type {!type:term_env array} (that is
    constructed when matching the LHS) to effectively apply the rule.

    During evaluation, we will only try to apply rewriting rules when reducing
    the application of a symbol [s] to a list of argument [ts]. At this point,
    [s.sym_rules] contains every rule [r] that may potentially apply. To check
    if [r] applies, one must match the elements of [r.lhs] with those of [ts],
    while building an environment [ar] of type {!type:term_env array}. In this
    process, a pattern of the form {!const:Patt(Some(i),s,ar)} matched against
    a term [u] intuitively results in [ar.(i)] being set to [u]. If every term
    can be matched against the corresponding pattern, the environment [ar] can
    then be substituted in [r.rhs] with [Bindlib.msubst r.rhs ar] to build the
    result of the application of the rewriting rule. *)

(** Representation of a metavariable for unification. *)
 and meta =
  { meta_name  : meta_name
  (** Unique name of the metavariable. *)
  ; meta_type  : term ref
  (** Type of the metavariable. *)
  ; meta_arity : int
  (** Arity of the metavariable (environment size). *)
  ; meta_value : (term, term) Bindlib.mbinder option ref
  (** Definition of the metavariable, if known. *) }

(** Representation of the name of a metavariable. *)
 and meta_name =
  | Defined  of string
  (** User-defined metavariable name. *)
  | Internal of int
  (** Generated metavariable identifier. *)

(** A metavariable is represented using a multiple binder, and it can hence be
    instantiated with an open term, provided that its free variables appear in
    the attached environment [ar] in terms of the form {!const:Meta(m,ar}. The
    environment [ar] should only contain (distinct) free variables, as for the
    {!const:Patt(i,s,ar)} constructor. *)

(** [unfold t] repeatedly unfolds the definition of the top level metavariable
    of [t] until a significant {!type:term} constructor is found. Note that it
    may an uninstantiated metavariable or any other form of term. However, the
    returned term cannot be an instantiated metavariable. In the case where no
    unfolding is required, the returned term is physically equal to [t]. *)
let rec unfold : term -> term = fun t ->
  match t with
  | Meta({meta_value = {contents = Some(b)}}, ar)
  | TEnv(TE_Some(b), ar) -> unfold (Bindlib.msubst b ar)
  | _                    -> t

(** Note that the {!val:unfold} function should (almost always) be used before
    matching over a value of type {!type:term}. *)
